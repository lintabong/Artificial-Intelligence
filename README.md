# Artificial Intelligence

a set of codes about artificial intelligence that I developed using matlab, python, and Google Collab

### 1. [k-Nearest Neighbour (MATLAB)](https://github.com/lintabong/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/k-NearestNeighbor)
<p>First, I create 100 random nodes between points (0,0) to (50,50) and (50,50) to points (100,100). Then bring up the dot in the middle of the axis, and look for the k-number of distances closest to that point.</p>

### 2. [Human Action Recognition using ML](https://github.com/lintabong/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/Human-Action-Recognition)
<p>The goal is to disslanthe the action on people's images using machine learning python with opencv and mediapipe. Dataset sampling is done by sampling photos using webcams and taken skeleton images.</p>

### 3. [Simulated Annealing on Transfer Salesman Problem](https://github.com/lintabong/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/Simulated-Annealing-on-TSP)
<p>TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) is a problem where a salesman must Visit all the cities where each city is only visited once, and he must start from and return to the city as long as. The goal is to determine the route with the total distance or the minimum cost..</p>
