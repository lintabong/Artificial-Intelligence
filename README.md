# Artificial Intelligence

a set of codes about artificial intelligence that I developed using matlab, python, and Google Collab

### 1. [k-Nearest Neighbour (MATLAB)](https://github.com/lintabong/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/k-NearestNeighbor)
<p>First, I create 100 random nodes between points (0,0) to (50,50) and (50,50) to points (100,100). Then bring up the dot in the middle of the axis, and look for the k-number of distances closest to that point.</p>

### 2. [Human Action Recognition using ML](https://github.com/lintabong/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/k-NearestNeighbor)
<p>First, I create 100 random nodes between points (0,0) to (50,50) and (50,50) to points (100,100). Then bring up the dot in the middle of the axis, and look for the k-number of distances closest to that point.</p>
